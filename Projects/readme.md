Hello! My name is Krystella.

Thank you for your interest in my _R_ projects.

In this repository, you will find scripts and documentation for projects I have undertaken to help build my proficiency in R. Some of these are related to courses/bootcamps/lectures I have participated in, and others were conceptualised independently. In each project, the source or inspiration will be clearly stated.
