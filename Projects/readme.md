Hello! My name is Krystella.

Thank you for your interest in my _R_ projects.

In this repository, you will find scripts and documentation for projects I have undertaken to help build my proficiency in R. Some of these are related to courses/bootcamps/lectures I have participated in, and others were conceptualised independently. In each project, the source or inspiration will be clearly stated.

I am currently enrolled in the _Data Science Specialization_ offered by John Hopkins University via Coursera - a comprehensive program demonstrating the use of R in various aspects of Data Science. 

Thus far, I have completed the following courses in the Specialization:
1. Data Science Toolbox
2. R Programming
3. Getting and Cleaning Data

I am currently working towards completion of the fourth course: _Exploratory Data Analysis_.
